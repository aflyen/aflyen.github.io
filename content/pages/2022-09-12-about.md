## About this blog
{{< figure src="/assets/pages/original-stamp.png" alt="Badge showing the text 'Guarranteed Original Product' referring to the content of this blog to be written and not produced with GenAI" class="right" >}}

The main purpose of this blog will be to share knowledge from my day-to-day professional experience, and hopefully be helping others with my contributions.

As more and more content becomes AI-generated, I believe it is important to still produce original content, with it's flaws and imperfect language and tone, to make sure that GenAI don't just repeat itself in the future and becomes a generic and less valuable tool.
