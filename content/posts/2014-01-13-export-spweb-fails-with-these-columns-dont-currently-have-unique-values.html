title: Export-SPWeb fails with "These columns don't currently have unique values"

---
<p>During a content database migration from SharePoint 2010 to 2013, we also had a requirement to move a few sites (SPWeb) to new locations. The plan was to first mount the Content Database on the SharePoint 2013 farm, create an evaluation upgrade site collection and then export the content from the upgraded site using "Export-SPWeb". This operation failed, and after several retries it seems like this is not supported.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">PowerShell command to export site:</span></p>
<p>[code language="PowerShell"]<br />
Export-SPWeb http://sps:8080/ -Path &quot;C:\Backup\sps-8080.bak&quot;<br />
[/code]</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>This problem seems to occur once you have created an evaluation site within the same content database. Deleting the evaluation site does not fix the problem unfortunately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Restore site collection from backup to a new content database</li>
<li>Export data with Export-SPWeb from the site, but avoid using an evaluation site.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to run Export-SPWeb both when the site collection is in 2010-mode and naturally after upgrading it to 2013 as long you stay away from creating an evaluation site.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>If you plan to reorganize the content in the same operation as a content database migration from SharePoint 2010 to 2013, avoid using an evaluation site as it leaves your entire site collection in a state where content cannot be exported. With this experience I now always take a extra site collection backup before using creating evaluation sites (which itself is a excellent feature).</p>
