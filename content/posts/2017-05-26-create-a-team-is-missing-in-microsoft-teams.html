<p>I came across a rare scenario when I was going to convert an existing Office 365 group to a Team. In Microsoft Teams ( https://teams.microsoft.com) I was unable to find the "Create a team" button. In my case I was logged on as a Global Admin and thought that I ruled the whole world, but then again no.</p>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>In Microsoft Teams:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selected "Add team" in the lower right</li>
<li>Expected to find the "Create a team" button (but where is it?)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>In this tenant the creation of Office 365 groups had been restricted for the end-users. This includes setting a AD group with the users allowed to do this.</p>

<p>MyÂ Global Admin user was not added to this AD group. It turns out a requirement for also converting existing group to teams also are affected by this policy. So simply by adding my user into this group I was able to see the missing button:</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>When restricting creation of Office 365 Groups, admin users must also explicit be added to this group to maintain full control over Groups and Teams creation.</p>
