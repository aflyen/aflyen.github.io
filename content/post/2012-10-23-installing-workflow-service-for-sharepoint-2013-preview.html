title: Installing workflow service for SharePoint 2013 Preview
type: post
url: /2012/10/23/installing-workflow-service-for-sharepoint-2013-preview/
---
<p>The workflow service in SharePoint 2013 Preview is no longer a part of the standard SharePoint server installation, and is provided by the Windows Workflow Manager (Azure). The service it self is a huge improvement to the product, but requires additional step as it has to be installed and configured post-installation of SharePoint Server 2013.</p>
<p>Getting the workflow service in SharePoint 2013 Preview up and running on my development environment gave me some challenges that wasn't well documented at the time, so I decided to list some of the error messages and steps that helped me getting it up and running properly.</p>
<h2>Installation and configuration</h2>
<p>I started my installation by following this documentation on TechNet:</p>
<p>Installation guide for Workflow Manager 1.0 Beta: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj193478">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj193478</a></p>
<p>Configuration guide for connecting SharePoint 2013 to Workflow Manager: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj658588(v=office.15)">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj658588(v=office.15)</a></p>
<h2>Error messages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Configuration wizard: Could not successfully create management Service Bus entity 'WF_Management/WFTOPIC' with multiple retries within timespan</li>
<li>Browsing the WF management site (http://localhost:12291/):"Object reference not set to an instance of an object"</li>
<li>Powershell: "The trusted provider certificate which is already in use." or  "Unable to properly communicate with the workflow endpoint"</li>
<li>Service App error (<a href="http://sps2013pre:9999/_admin/WorkflowServiceStatus.aspx">/_admin/WorkflowServiceStatus.aspx</a>): "SharePoint was unable to communicate with the Workflow host"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips for troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check which regional settings are used on your setup and admin account. When I used something else than “English (United States) I got an error when accessing the configuration database.</li>
<li>Remember to start SQL Server Browser, and keep it to start automatic.</li>
<li>Grant the workflow service account the server roles “dbcreator” and “securityadmin” in SQL Server.</li>
<li>Grant the workflow service account local administrator rights on the server.</li>
<li>Run the workflow configuration wizard logged in as the workflow service account.</li>
<li>Use a FQDN for the account in the configuration wizard (default suggestion is wrong).</li>
<li>To clean up a failed installation:
<ul>
<li>Run workflow configuration wizard, and remove the server from the workflow farm.</li>
<li>Manually delete the databases created (prefixed with Wf and Sb in default installation).</li>
<li>If registered with SharePoint, remove the service application “App Fabric Application Proxy”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is possible to run the registration with SharePoint, Register-SPWorkflowService, with a “-Force” switch to get pass a state where it tells you it already has been registered, but still fails.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This article gives some tips for resolving different errors occurring either when installing the workflow service, or when connecting it with SharePoint.</p>
