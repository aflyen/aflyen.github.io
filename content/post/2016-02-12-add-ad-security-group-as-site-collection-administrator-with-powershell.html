title: Add AD security group as Site Collection administrator with PowerShell in SharePoint

<p>In provisioning solutions it can be a good practice to add a security group from Active Directory as an additional site collection owner.Â Unfortunately a security group is not accepted as either primary or secondary owner. So to set a group as site collection administrator, the easiest approach I could find was to set the "IsSiteAdmin" property on the User object.</p>
