<p lang="en-US">This is a summary of an issue we have had with publishing pages not being indexed, and then unable to build the search-driven pages we wanted using for example Content Search Web Part. This occured in SharePoint Online (Office 365) and we have only had this issue with a couple of tenants. So my guess is that most tenants are working fine, but if you should come across this strange behavior, I hope this post can help you save some time.</p>
<h2>The issue</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Created a Publishing Site</li>
<li>Added a Content Type and a Page Layout, created a few test articles</li>
<li>Added a Content Search Web Part and set up a query to return articles for the Content Type created above</li>
<li>Waited a long time (normal)</li>
<li>No results (oops)</li>
<li>Tried to reindex the library (curious)</li>
<li>No results (worried)</li>
<li>Retried all the steps (scared)</li>
<li>No results (desperate)</li>
<li>Got coffee (calm)</li>
<li>No results (called support)</li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-US">I guess you get it. Something was very wrong and I was stuck on not getting any results back. On-Premises this would probable been one of those situations a full crawl, or at worst a index reset, had fixed it. But running in Office 365 we don't have these abilities.</p>
<h2>The workaround</h2>
<p lang="en-US">After some trial and error I understood what was causing the issue, and got this workaround:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Go to "Site Settings"</li>
<li>Select "Navigation" under "Look and feel"</li>
<li>Uncheck these options:
<ul type="circle">
<li>Add new pages to navigation automatically</li>
<li>Create friendly URLs for new pages automatically</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>All pages created and published after making this change was indexed and showed up as expected. Unfortunately all the pages created before doing this change was a lost cause. Believe me, I tried a lot but unable to get them indexed.</p>
<h2>The fix</h2>
<p lang="en-US">As being on Office 365 this issue was addressed with Microsoft Support, and after a while they released a fix.</p>
<p lang="en-US">Unfortunately I suspect this error can still occur in some scenarios, and to make sure we don't run into this trouble again, a recommendation is to avoid using the Managed Navigation set up as shown above just to be safe.</p>
